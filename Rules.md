# Techy Girls is a safe space
* The chat is not just SFW, but also sex-free. That means no references to sex, sexual organs, or sexual content, not even obliquely or medically.
* If you find yourself trying to phrase something so as to be acceptable, that is a sign it is **not** okay
* Keep discussions about medical treatments to a mimimum. Talking about health and transition is more than okay, but shy away from specifics
* You will not be called out or punished for bringing concerns to the moderators or admins. If you have a problem or need to discuss something that is making you uncomfortable, please don't hesitate
* We have a chat for potentially triggering or NSFW things. If you find youself wanting to talk about these topics, then take it to the other chat. Forward the message there then reply to it, for example. Or just go off on a tangent (but be nice to Tangent)
