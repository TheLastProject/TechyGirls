# Techy Girls is a safe space for women and especially survivors of sexual abuse


## All of Our Chats are Places of Cooperation and Kindness

* Be Kind
* All women are welcome, cis or trans and also other non-male-identifying people
* You will not be called out or punished for bringing concerns to the moderators or admins. If you have a problem or need to discuss something that is making you uncomfortable, please don't hesitate
* Avoid unnecessary negativity. For example:
  * Don't tell someone that their tool of choice sucks. You don't like it, apparently for a reason. Share your reasons if you must but it is rarely the case that something is entirely bad
  * When people are helping each other that is a time to be constructive. They probably don't want to change distros or learn a new programming language. Try to see if your insights can help, but try to understand their needs and limitations
  * Be sure you understand why someone disagrees with you. It never hurt to ask for more information
  * Agree when you agree. Where there is common ground be sure to point it out, its usually a good starting point


## The Rated G Chat is a Place With No Sex and Safe From Triggers

* The chat is not just SFW, but also sex-free. That means no references to sex, sexual organs, or sexual content, not even obliquely or medically
* If you find yourself trying to phrase something so as to be acceptable, that is a sign it is **not** okay
* Keep discussions about medical treatments to a mimimum. Talking about health and transition is more than okay, but shy away from specifics

## The NSFW Chat is not for Porn

* The chat is NSFW but is not for sexually explicit content, There is a chat specifically for that. No porn and no descriptions of sexual acts
* The chat may sometimes contain hard or potentially triggering topics, as such they will be approached with the maturity and delicacy that they deserve


## Smutty Girls is for Porn, but isn't a free-for-all
