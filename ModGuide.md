* Don't assume how people are feeling or what they mean or why they are saying certain things. Ask them, and ask early
* Sometimes people need to feel heard, and trying to find common ground even when there are points of disagreement helps
* Step in before disagreements turn into fights, it is your job as a moderator to be a moderating force even when you don't personally care about the topic
* Approach with kindness, you are backed up by everyone. You don't need to act strong to be storng
* Assume everything will be okay until it isn't
* Don't make a spectacle out of someone's mistake, take it to PM
* If you aren't comfortable dealing with an issue yourself ask for help, you aren't alone
